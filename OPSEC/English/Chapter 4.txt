1) A happy ending
A happy ending is, in my opinion, you deciding for yourself that you've done your time and that it's time to move on. In a happy ending, you'll follow three main stages:
-The destruction of the digital persona: this is when you say goodbye to your friends, partners and so on. This can be done in the normal way (you send a last message to the people you've known, you destroy your accounts, your PGP keys, etc.), or through an “exit scam”. An exit scam is basically a final scam, through which you try to recover as much money as possible by playing on people's sense of trust, etc. Once you've done that, I recommend destroying your accounts on the various platforms you use, then permanently destroying your PGP keys so that nobody can ever impersonate you. Then you'll need to “wipe clean” your various OSes, using nautilus-wipe for example. Once this has been done, I recommend that you wipe the OS directly using the same method.
-Destroying physical hardware: now's the time to destroy all physical evidence of your former activity. To do this, I recommend microwaving your RAM (to avoid a cold boot attack) and your hard disk, if you have one (to avoid magnetic persistence). Next, I recommend that you cut up everything that makes up your PC and can be identified/traced (motherboard, RAM, SSD, hard disk, graphics card, etc.) into small pieces, then burn everything in a place without too many people around (e.g. in dense wood, in the mountains, etc.). Afterwards, you'll need to collect the resulting waste and dispose of it using the method of your choice. Ultimately, almost no data can be recovered from these fragments, but for the sake of form, I recommend burying them or putting them in the sea (while respecting the ecology, of course).
-Return to normal life: this is the last stage of the plan. It involves forgetting everything you know and everything you've heard about the subject you're hiding. Many people get caught after they've completely stopped what they were doing, then talked too much about it, thinking that nothing more could happen to them. It's important to understand that the danger is always there until you're LEGALLY no longer responsible for what you've done.

2) An abrupt end
An abrupt end is, in my opinion, the police or some attacker who decides that you've done your time and that it's time to go and spend some time in the shade. When this kind of thing happens, you need to:
Switch off all your devices: if they're encrypted at start-up (i.e. if you've followed this guide), the attacker won't have access to the data stored on them.
-Pray that they don't have a backdoor that records everything you do on your PCs and phones.
-Say nothing, get a lawyer and let life take its course
