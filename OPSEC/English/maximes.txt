The first rule of OPSEC: never discuss OPSEC.
Encrypt everything; assume no data is ever secure in plain text.
Compartmentalize your digital life to prevent cross-contamination of identities.
A strong password today is weak tomorrow—regularly update them.
No software is secure; only use open-source, vetted software when possible.
Data leaks often start with physical access; secure your devices physically.
Assume every device can be compromised; use separate devices for separate purposes.
Anonymity is built, not bought—be cautious with “privacy” services.
Online, never mix real and alias information, even accidentally.
Treat every email and link as suspect until proven safe.
If it’s inconvenient, it’s probably good OPSEC.
Avoid tracking; disable cookies, user tracking, and unnecessary permissions.
Fake personas should have plausible details and consistency.
Always verify software hashes before installation.
Never rely on one line of defense; redundancy is key.
Use burner phones or virtual numbers for communication that requires anonymity.
Virtual machines can shield but won’t save you from physical compromise.
Always securely erase files—deletion does not mean gone.
Log out, clear cookies, and close browsers when done.
Assume your adversary knows more about your habits than you think.
Verify network security settings—no open ports unless necessary.
If you wouldn’t say it in public, don’t put it online.
Hide sensitive data in encrypted containers on external drives.
Use unique passwords for every service to minimize impact if breached.
Disable all unnecessary OS services and restrict permissions.
VPNs and Tor are tools, not complete solutions; use wisely.
A compromised machine must be wiped and reset—no exceptions.
When in doubt, assume data is logged; minimize what you share.
Trust is earned, and rarely extended to cloud services.
Physical destruction is the final backup for secure data removal.
